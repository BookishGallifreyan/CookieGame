This is a test note.

Ok, so, I've got a potato farm and it's always steadily producing potatoes no matter what and I've got a counter to show the user how many potatoes they have. They can speed up the process by clicking the potato button to farm more. The currency system is broken, I admit, but I used the old adage 'You've got to spend potatoes to make potatoes' as my base-point so I've put a small shop where you can get upgrades should you desire to make it go faster find yourself drowning in potatoes.
If you don't have enough, you'll get a message telling you so and to save up a few more.

Currently, I have one major snag in that when you end your day of farming by refreshing the page potato mites devour everything and so you lose all your progress!

(Is that it, is this not a bug but a feature...?)

This is really fustrating, it feels like every time I thnk I've got it, I'm actually two steps further away or have managed to break something else in the process.
I've had a chat to Phil and he had a look and tried to help but just as I thought I'd got it, I went to try and implement it and it's not doing what I want it to. I've watched youtube videos, gone back over the appropriate moodle pages, looked at my notes and previous folders, searched through forums to see if other people have had similar issues, searched through mdn\_ for different definitions and explanations and all to no avail. Whatever combination I use, I can't seem to marry up the logic.
I'm sorry. It's gotten to a point where my eyes are blurry and I can keep on trying and it not go in or I can submit and 'fail' and go and touch some grass.

(I've left my attempts commented out so you can see my working out)
